# Course-Search-Page

1. In order to not mess up with our frontend folder, I just push the thing I have right now here. 'cause I haven't figured out the app.js (should be the pages according to Yue's template)and index.js independency.
2. It is right now a complete mess regarding UI design part (观感极度不适), I will continuously working on this part once I fixed how to use bootstrap in react and how to adapt html in jsx beautifully with css.
3. Component for reuse 1)searchbox(works fine within frontend for now); 2) scroll(you may need to the change the size if you want to reuse); 3)Courselist(right now just feed static data);
4. I am shitty slow!!!!
